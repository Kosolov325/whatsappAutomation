# Whatsapp Automation
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

I was idle and a friend of mine showed me a funny whatsapp javascript lib, so in that momment i realized that i had a job to do: an ~~useless~~ useful bot to automatize some default tasks that i have to face everyday like: rejecting calls, spamming nerd stickers and others.


## Requirements
- Node v12+
- MongoDB (i do recommend mongo db atlas)

## Env example
``` node
DATABASE_URI = 'mongodb://USER:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME/'
ISNERDLIST = 'javascript, js, python, vou estudar, jogar, cs, mount and blade, mb, nw, native, counter strike, java, cobol, aws, gcloud, amazom, gigachad'
FORBIDDENCHATS = '120363038861907009@g.us, 120363045550290155@g.us, 13314479999@c.us, 5535998780224@c.us, 556976420633@c.us'
```

## Installation
``` node
npm install .
npm start
#enjoy
```
