# Whatsapp Automation
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

I was idle and a friend of mine showed me a funny whatsapp javascript lib, so in that momment i realized that i had a job to do: an ~~useless~~ useful bot to automatize some default tasks that i have to face everyday like: rejecting calls, spamming nerd stickers and others.
